knex-schema-builder
===================

[![npm Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/knex-schema-builder.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/knex-schema-builder)

I built this little helper so I can have a way of easily describing a database schema and automate the process of database initialization for an installation of a project - or migration of the database to newer versions.
It works on top of *knex*, and most functions require passing a *knex* instance.

The concept is like this:

1. You have a folder in your project containing the description of the schema.
   * `schema.json` - Contains the full schema for a fresh installation (used also for data in upgrade schemas)
   * `upgrade.####.json` - Contains an upgrade script for a single version
   * `version.json` - Contains the current DB version. A version is a whole number, and is 1-based. You could start with any number you like.
2. You call either `install` or `upgrade` in order to install a fresh database or migrate.
3. You can call `isInstallNeeded` and `isUpgradeNeeded` to determine if you need to call `install` or `upgrade`. Maybe use it to automatically redirect to a screen telling the admin that a fresh installation or an upgrade process is about to begin...
4. You can manually call individual helper functions to create a table, column etc. (i.e. when you create tables dynamically with a predefined schema...)
5. Call `setTablePrefix(prefix)` before any `install` or `upgrade`, if you want to prefix the table names with something. (Use `{table_prefix}` as a placeholder in raw statements).

Usage example:

```javascript

var knex = require('knex'),
    schemaInstaller = require('knex-schema-builder'),
    db = knex(require('./db-config.js')),
    schemaPath = path.join(__dirname, './db_schema');

// In order to initialize a fresh db
schemaInstaller.install(db, schemaPath, function (err) { ... });

// In order to upgrade a db... We can call "upgrade" directly, 
//   or we can tell the user that an upgrade is needed and that 
//   he should authorize the upgrade process.
schemaInstaller.isUpgradeNeeded(db, schemaPath, function (err, required) {

  if (err) {

    // Handle error...

  } else {

    if (required) {

      installer.upgrade(db, schemaPath, function(err){

        if (err) {
          // An error occurred...
          // Please take care of the problem manually, 
          // and then try to run the upgrade routine again.
        } else {
          // Your database has been upgraded successfully!
        }

      });

    } else {

      // Your database is up to date! No upgrade needed

    }

  }

});

```

## Structure for the *version.json*

Simply
````javascript
{ "version": 1 }
````

## Structure for the *upgrade.####.json*

* Name of each file contains the version to which you upgrade to. i.e upgrade.2.json contains the schema for upgrading from version 1 to version 2.
* The schema is an array of actions, each action has the key `action` set, and its options.
* Each action can optionally have a `min_version` and/or `max_version` to specify limits for specific action, whether or not it will be executed. (i.e if upgrading from an older version, you might not want to create certain columns as they have already been created due to a `createTable` action.)
* Each action can optionally have a `"ignore_errors": true` specified to ignore errors on the specific action.

### Samples for *upgrade.####.json*

#### A simple upgrade
```
upgrade.2.json
[
  { "action": "dropForeign", "table": "user", "name": "fk_user_to_some_old_table" },
  { "action": "dropTable", "table": "some_old_table" },
  { "action": "createTable", "table": "user_special_data" },
  { "action": "createTableIndexes", "table": "user_special_data" },
  { "action": "createTableForeignKeys", "table": "user_special_data" },
  { "action": "execute", "query": "INSERT INTO user_special_data (id) SELECT id FROM user" },

]
```

#### A case of adding a column, to a table that is created in another upgrade.

```
upgrade.8.json
[
  { "action": "addColumn", "table": "user_special_data", "column": "estimated_age", "min_version": 2 },
]
```

What happens here, is that in the upgrade to version *2*, the table `user_special_data` was created. And if a user tries to upgrade from version *1* to version *10*, then the table will be created with all of it's columns, and the `addColumn` in upgrade step *8* will fail because it already exists.  
The solution is the `min_version`, which means that this action will only take place if the version you are upgrading from is at least *2*, which means that the table already existed and does not have the new column yet.

### Actions for *upgrade.####.json* schema

* `execute (query)`: Execute the query in `query` key
* `createTable (table)`: Create the table named `table`, without its indexes and foreign keys. You usually want to postpone those to the end of the script.
* `createTableIndexes (table)`: Creates the indexes for table named `table`
* `createTableForeignKeys (table)`: Creates the foreign keys for table named `table`
* `addColumn (table, column)`: Creates the specified column (`column`) in table named `table`
* `changeColumn (table, column)`: Alters the specified column (`column`) in table named `table`
* `renameColumn (table, from, to)`: Renames the `from` column to `to` in table named `table`
* `createIndex (table, name, columns, unique)`: Creates an index on the specified `table`, using the same syntax as in the schema file
* `createForeign (table, columns, foreign_table, foreign_columns, on_delete, on_update)`: Creates a foreign key on the specified `table`, using the same syntax as in the schema file
* `dropColumn (table, column)`: Drops the specified column (`column`) in table named `table`
* `dropTable (table)`: Drops the table named `table`
* `dropPrimary (table)`: Drops the primary key in the table named `table`
* `dropIndex (table, column)`: Drops the index on the specified column/columns (`column` can be an array or a single string) on table named `table`
* `dropIndex (table, name)`: Drops the index named `name` in table named `table`
* `dropForeign (table, column)`: Drops the foreign key on the specified column/columns (`column` can be an array or a single string) on table named `table`
* `dropForeign (table, name)`: Drops the foreign key named `name` in table named `table`
* `dropUnique (table, column)`: Drops the unique constraint the specified column/columns (`column` can be an array or a single string) in table named `table`
* `dropUnique (table, name)`: Drops the unique constraint named `name` in table named `table`
* `addTimestamps (table)`: Adds the timestamps (*created_at* and *updated_at*) in the table named `table`
* `dropTimestamps (table)`: Drops the timestamps (*created_at* and *updated_at*) in the table named `table`
